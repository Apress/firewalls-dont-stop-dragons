# Errata for *Firewalls Don't Stop Dragons* (4th ed)


## General Note on Web Links in the Book

The book is chock full of web links and web links will change all the time. I will try to keep an updated set of links in [this web page](https://firewallsdontstopdragons.com/book-links-v4/). If you find any links in the book or these documents that are wrong, please let me know!

## Updated Information

### Chapter 7, page 241: Panopticlick --> Cover Your Tracks

The wonderful EFF tool Panopticlick has been upgraded and renames to [Cover Your Tracks](https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/). The old Panopticlick link
should automatically re-route you to the new site.

## Errata

### Tip 4-12: Perform a Security Check in LastPass

It appears that LastPass has now automated this in the [new Security Dashboard](https://blog.lastpass.com/2020/08/new-lastpass-security-dashboard-and-dark-web-monitoring-now-available/). One downside: it looks like you can't manually re-run the security check. So if you make some changes, you can't see immediately how your score has improved. I can only assume the score will be updated periodically, but not sure how often.

### Tip 8-4: Send Files Securely Using the Web

Unfortunately, Firefox has [discontinued](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/09/17/update-on-firefox-send-and-firefox-notes/) it's wonderful, free, secure file sending tool called Firefox Send. I managed to sneak in a note about that into the book before it was published, but I'd like to suggest a couple alternatives here.

* **[Swiss Transfer](https://www.swisstransfer.com/en):** I think this service is closer to what Firefox Send was. It allows you to limit the number of downloads, the number of days the link will work, or both. You can also set a password for the link.
* **[Filemail](https://www.filemail.com/):** Another nice and secure service for sending large files. You can either do it as an email or using a link.
* **[FileTransfer.io](https://filetransfer.io/):** This is the one I mentioned in the book's footnote. But I prefer Swiss Transfer.
