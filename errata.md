# Errata for *Firewalls Don't Stop Dragons* (4th ed)


## General Note on Web Links in the Book

The book is chock full of web links and web links will change all the time. I will try to keep an updated set of links in [this web page](https://firewallsdontstopdragons.com/book-links-v4/). If you find any links in the book or these documents that are wrong, please let me know!

### Tip 8-4: Send Files Securely Using the Web

Unfortunately, Firefox has [discontinued](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/09/17/update-on-firefox-send-and-firefox-notes/) it's wonderful, free, secure file sending tool called Firefox Send. I managed to sneak in a note about that into the book before it was published, but I'd like to suggest a couple alternatives here.

* **[Swiss Transfer](https://www.swisstransfer.com/en):** I think this service is closer to what Firefox Send was. It allows you to limit the number of downloads, the number of days the link will work, or both. You can also set a password for the link.
* **[Filemail](https://www.filemail.com/):** Another nice and secure service for sending large files. You can either do it as an email or using a link.
* **[FileTransfer.io](https://filetransfer.io/):** This is the one I mentioned in the book's footnote. But I prefer Swiss Transfer.
