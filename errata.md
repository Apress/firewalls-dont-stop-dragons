# Errata for *Firewalls Don't Stop Dragons*

## General Note

The book is chock full of web links and web links will change all the time. I will try to keep an updated set of links in [this document](BookLinks_v3.md).

## On **page 65** [Missing web site]:
 
On page 13, I tell you to refer to Tip 2-1 for a handy web tool, but **neglected to include the link**. You can either use the local [Book Links](BookLinks_v3.md) document or you can use the version on my [website]](https://firewallsdontstopdragons.com/book-links-v3/).
